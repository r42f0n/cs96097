Please read the following instructions carefully. You   may   use either   Excel OR Mathcad to answer the following   problem. NOT BOTH! Not all   required   items are specified   in the   in   the instructions. You   must decide   what   is   important and should   be   included   in the   solution   of   this problem.   For example,   items such as standard   deviations,   error   bars,   correlation   coefficients, etc,   must   be   included where appropriate and/or   necessary. You   may   be   required to   refer to the   CHEM   140   manual for some   pertinent equations/formulas. 
The   method of standard addition   is   used   in   instrumental analysis to   determine the concentration of a substance   (analyte)   in an   unknown   sample. In this   method,   a   known   amount of the analyte   is added to the   unknown solution. A   measured   response   of   this   solution   is determined   before and after the addition of   the   standard. From   the   measured   response increase due to the   increased analyte concentration, the   original   concentration   can   be determined.    Since the   measured   response   (signal)   is   proportional to analyte concentration, we   can   say that
concentration   of   analyte   in   unknown                                    signal   from   unknown
concentration   of   analyte   + standard   in   mixture                  signal   from   mixture
The standard addition equation   is given   by   Equation   1,where   [X]i    is the   unknown   initial concentration of   the analyte,   which   yields   a   signal   of   IX.      After   the standard was added,   [X]f      is the final concentration   of   the   unknown   代 写CHEM 140 ‐ Sample Final Evaluation
代做程序编程语言analyte   and   [S]f      is   the	   final concentration of the standard.    After the   standard was   added,   IX+S      is   the   signal   measured.
If we define the   initial volume of the   unknown   as V0,   the   volume   of   the   standard   added   as   VS,   and final volume of the   mixture as V   (Note, V   does   not   necessarily   equal V0    + VS),the   final concentrations of the   unknown analyte and standard   are   given   by   Equations   2   and   3,   respectively. 

By substituting the expressions for   [X]i      (Equation   2) and   [S]i      (Equation   3)   into the   standard addition equation   (Equation   1) and   rearranging, we obtain the   expression   given   by   Equation   4.

An experimental analysis was conducted to determine   theiron   (Fe)   content   in   drinking   water.   The drinking water was analyzed   using the standard   addition   method,   described   above.      The concentration of theiron   (Fe) standard   solution was   11.1   ppm.    All   solutions were   diluted   to   a         final volume of 50.0   mL.    The   iron   in the drinking water   samples   were   experimentally   analyzed      by   using an   instrument called an atomic   absorption   spectrophotometer   (AAS).    The   experiment   results are given   in Table   1,   below.
